# DiabetesPrediction

This project is a diabetes prediction model that uses machine learning algorithms to predict whether a person has diabetes based on several input factors such as age, BMI, blood pressure, and glucose levels. The model was built using [algorithm(s)].


## Installation

To run the diabetes prediction model on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetes-prediction.git
   cd diabetes-prediction
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. You should now be ready to run the project.
